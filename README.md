# StarWarsGPT

StarWarsGPT is a Star Wars-inspired CLI wrapper for interacting with OpenAI's ChatGPT API. Simply choose your favorite character from the Star Wars universe and the CLI will respond accordingly.

Current priorities include Anakin Skywalker, C3-PO, Obi Wan Kenobi, Darth Sidious (the Emperor), Darth Vader, and of course, the ever-important HK-47 (from Knights of the Old Republic). Future advances will include custom datasets that include the unique dialogue of the Star Wars universe.

Example: 

Definition: Master, 'Love' is making a shot to the knees of a target 120 kilometers away using an Aratech sniper rifle with a tri-light scope... Love is knowing your target, putting them in your targeting reticule, and together, achieving a singular purpose against statistically long odds."
