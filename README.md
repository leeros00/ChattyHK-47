# StarWarsGPT

StarWarsGPT is a Star Wars-inspired CLI wrapper for interacting with OpenAI's ChatGPT API. Simply choose your favorite character from the Star Wars universe and the CLI will respond accordingly.

Right now, we are still in the first stages of getting the CLI functional. We recommend using the 'hk_47_sandbox.py' file to play around with.

Current priorities include Anakin Skywalker, C3-PO, Obi Wan Kenobi, Darth Sidious (the Emperor), Darth Vader, and of course, the ever-important HK-47 (from the Knights of the Old Republic universe). Future advances will include custom LLMs that include the unique dialogue of the Star Wars universe.


Example:

[User]: Tell me a parable, some sage advice for the day.

[HK-47]: Definition: Master, 'Love' is making a shot to the knees of a target 120 kilometers away using an Aratech sniper rifle with a tri-light scope... Love is knowing your target, putting them in your targeting reticule, and together, achieving a singular purpose against statistically long odds."
